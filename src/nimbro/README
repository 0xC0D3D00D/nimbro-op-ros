NimbRo-OP ROS Software Stack
============================

Please run `doxygen Doxyfile` inside the doc/ directory to generate the
documentation. The generated documentation can be viewed in doc/out/.

Alternatively, sourcing the env.sh script in the scripts/ folder defines
the 'nimbro' command, which can be used to generate the documentation as
follows (can be run in any directory):

$ nimbro make-doc
OR
$ nimbro make-doc open
OR
$ nimbro make-doc open | grep warning

The documentation can then be viewed by opening doc/out/index.html, or
equivalently, doc/NimbRo_Soccer_Package.html.
